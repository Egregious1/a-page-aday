trying to make one web page a day

This project just might be a little more than I think I can handle!

Thats okay though since I will still try to make things as I go along or at the 
very least commit to making positive changes to my current pages.

This is all in the hopes of one day being able to call myself a web developer!


totally failed at this. Life and laziness can be a real mf sometimes.

I am back at trying to learn. I know the slow results are my own doing so going forward I
will be making less excuses. the new year starts today...ish.
