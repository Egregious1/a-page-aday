			Hi, my name is Brian Kahler. I have been having a rough time trying to teach myself to be a web developer. It has been a great but challenging ride so far, but I have had my share of misgivings. I am not a person that that has a very long attention span which makes sitting and learning things from videos a challenge to say the least. Its been months now that I have taken a serious look at myself and decided that this is something that I wanted to pursue and I did. I think I made some great headway with learning how to setup a page with HTML and stylize it using CSS. I haven't spent nearly enough time learning JavaScript as I would have liked at this point but I believed that maybe it was just too many things to jam into my head and expect to have it stick. Any who...Today I am starting my web page a day challenge to myself. Where I will try on a daily basis make a simple web page to learn specific things about CSS and Javascript. I am focusing on those since I believe that I have a pretty good understanding on how to use HTML, at least enough to be able to hold my own along side a little googling. This blog is to show myself and anyone else who comes across it my thought process and hopefully one day show that anyone with a little bit of will power can learn to code. Right now I am loving the little bit that I know from the random parts of the internet I have learned and I am excited to see where this project will take me next. My first project was an incredibly simple checklist to help me visualize what my plans are. Its absolutely a wip which will be everything I work on here but its a start. I decided to use a ul element instead of just inputs because I want them to be stacked with out having to write too many lines of code. This did give me some problems when I tried to center the whole thing but I think its because I don't totally understand how to move things with in the box model. I really don't even know if that idea is even accurate. It's still day one after all. My next plan is to learn how to make a color changer using only CSS if its possible. I think my biggest problem will be coming up with an idea a day but I think I can have the internet and YouTube to help me. I want to be able to avoid just doing tutorials but I do think that they will have a positive place in the project of mine. I will also be uploading everything that I make onto my GitHub which you can find in the about me section of this page. If you check it out let me know how you would do things differently. I don't have too many people helping me with this if any at all to be honest so any feed back will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
